# HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language

This folder contains all the projects I completed to gain knowledge in HTML, the language used to create and structure web pages. These projects helped me to understand the basics of HTML and build proficiency in creating different types of web content.

It is important to note that the intellectual property rights for these projects belong to Dr. Angela Yu, a skilled developer and lead instructor who created the course that I followed to learn HTML. As such, any use of the code or content in this folder should be done with respect for her intellectual property rights and in compliance with any licensing agreements or terms of use provided by Dr. Yu.
